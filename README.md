# Hello React-Rails

This is a project from the sixth module of the Microverse program. With it, we learned how to build applications using the `react-rails` gem on `Ruby on Rails`.

This application has `Home` page and a `Greet` page. You can go to the `Greet` by clicking on the link in the `Home` page. Once there, you can generate a greeting by clicking on the `Be greeted` button. Don't be afraid if you get greeted in different languages. That's just the way it works. üòâ
